# Data-Mining

Your task is to cluster the dataset into an optimal number of clusters, your steps will be as follows:

     ● Choose your preferred clustering real-world application

     ● Download any suitable datasets from (Kaggle, UCI repository, etc.)

     ● Assess and clean your data if needed ( you can use preprocessed data.)

     ● Import the required libraries and perform:

1. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm, find K clusters, using single linkage strategy, considering Euclidean 

distance as the distance measure.

■ Visualize your results.

2. K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm find K clusters, use the Manhattan distance.

■ Visualize your results

     ● Conduct a comparison between the 2 Algorithms results
